\maketitle


A pathogen has an effective within-host population size of $N_e=100$ and a generation time $g=1$ day, so that the within-host coalescent rate is $N_e g=100/365$ years. The basic reproduction number is $R=1$. To following command simulates an outbreak of this pathogen: 
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> simu <- simulateOutbreak(R=1,neg=100/365)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

This simulation contains both the transmission tree between infected hosts and the within-host phlogenetic tree of each host. This can be visualised as a colored phlogenetic tree, where each host is represented by a unique color:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
